                <p>I'm a first-generation student studying at the College of Wooster. I'm a third year majoring in Studio Art with a focus in animation. I aim to learn as much as possible about everything possible in order to be prepared for what comes next. What’s next? The dream is to work in a Stop-Motion Animation studio. I plan on making it there by taking on several internships in the field to gain key experience that’ll put them one step ahead.</p>
                <p>I have loved art and anything creative their whole life, hopping from hobby to hobby. From Robotics, to Theatre, to Creative Writing, to Filmmaking, you name it, I've probably tried it out! This was until I discovered that making stop-motion animations is a possible career path. It changed everything, I became motivated to learn whatever they hadn’t already and be a strong animator. That journey is far from complete, but I'm not going to stop until the dream is reality!</p>
                <p>A few of <strong>my other interests</strong> include music and queer novels.</p>
